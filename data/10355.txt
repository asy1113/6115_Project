  Massive bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the bilateral distal, lobar and
  multiple proximal segmental pulmonary arteries.  Focal gound glass opacity in
  the left upper lobe may represent focal infarction, although follow up films
  are recommended to ensure resolution.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  39-year-old male with positive D-dimer.

 COMPARISONS:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images from the thoracic inlet through the upper
 abdomen were obtained following administration of 150 cc of intravenous
 Optiray contrast using a gated chest pain protocol.  Multiplanar
 reconstructions were performed.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are large bilateral pulmonary arterial
 filling defects consistent with pulmonary emboli.  These involve the distal
 main left and right pulmonary arteries extending into multiple lobar,
 segmental and subsegmental branches.  The aorta is normal in caliber and
 contour without focal dissection.  Air is seen within several venous
 structures likely secondary to the injection.  The heart, pericardium and
 great vessels appear within normal limits.  Airways are patent to the
 subsegmental level bilaterally.  There are no pathologically enlarged
 mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymph nodes.  Lung windows demonstrate a focal
 subpleural ground glass opacity in the left upper lobe best visualized on
 series 3, image 53.  No pulmonary nodules or pleural effusions are identified.

 In the visualized upper abdomen, the imaged portions of the liver dome,
 stomach and spleen appear within normal limits.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No fractures or osseous findings suspicious for malignancy are
 identified.  There are moderate degenerative changes within the thoracic
 spine.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli as described above.  No evidence of
 aortic dissection.
 2.  Focal subpleural ground glass opacity in the left upper lobe.  This
                                                             (Over)

 finding may represent a focal pulmonary infarction.  However, the possibility
 of an infectious etiology or bronchogenic alveolar carcinoma cannot be
 entirely excluded, and followup imaging is recommended to ensure resolution.

 Findings were discussed with Dr.
